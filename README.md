# Application Requirements

## User Stories

As a **cloud service provider**, I want to **isolate client resources** so that I can **host multiple clients on the same hardware**.

As an **enterprise user**, I want to **seperate sensitive data on to its own system** to **provide additional security**.

As a **healthcare provider**, I want to **isolate identifying information from other data** to **comply with HIPAA regulations**.

As an **enterprise user**, I want to **provide an isolated environment from production systems** so that I can **safely perform malware analysis**.

As a **corporation**, I want to **run multiple virtual systems on the same hardware** in order to **reduce cost and space requirements**.
